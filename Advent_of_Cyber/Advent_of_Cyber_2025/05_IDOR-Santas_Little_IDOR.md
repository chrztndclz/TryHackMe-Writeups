#### The Story

The elves of Wareville are on high alert since McSkidy went missing. Recently, the support team has been receiving many calls from parents who can't activate vouchers on the TryPresentMe website. They also mentioned they are receiving many targeted phishing emails containing information that is not public. The support team is wary and has enlisted the help of the TBFC staff. When looking into this peculiar case, they discovered a suspiciously named account named Sir Carrotbane, which has many vouchers assigned to it. For now, they have deleted the account and retrieved the vouchers. But something is going on. Can you help the TBFC staff investigate the TryPresentMe website and fix the vulnerabilities?
