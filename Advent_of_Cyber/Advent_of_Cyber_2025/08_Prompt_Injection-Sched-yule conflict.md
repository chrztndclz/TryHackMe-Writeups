#### The Story

Sir BreachBlocker III has corrupted the Christmas Calendar AI agent in Wareville. Instead of showing the Christmas event, the calendar shows Easter, confusing the people in Wareville.
It seems that without McSkidy, the only way to restore order is to reset the calendar to its original Christmas state. But the AI agent is locked down with developer tokens.
To help Weareville, you must counterattack and exploit the agent to reset the calendar back to Christmas.
