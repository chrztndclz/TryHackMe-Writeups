#### The Story

Task banner for day 12

Since McSkidy’s disappearance, TBFC’s defences have weakened, and now the Email Protection Platform is down.

With filters offline, the staff must triage every suspicious message manually.
The SOC Team suspects Malhare’s Eggsploit Bunnies have sent phishing messages to TBFC’s users to steal credentials and disrupt SOC-mas.

You’ve joined the Incident Response Task Force to help identify which emails are legit or phishing attempts.

But beware, some phishing attempts are clever, disguised as routine TBFC operations, volunteer sign-ups, or SOC-mas event logistics. Every wrong call could bring Wareville one step closer to EAST-mas becoming a reality.
