## Description

Linux powers most servers worldwide, and knowing how to search within it is a must for any defender.

Objective:
Locate McSkidy’s hidden message in his Linux home directory.

Steps:

Use cd /home/mcskidy/ to enter his folder.

Run ls -la to show all files.

Use cat .secret_message to reveal the flag.
