## The Great Disappearing Act

#### Hopper the Court Jester 

Once upon a time, there was a red-teaming mastermind turned court jester… our story begins with Hopper. Once feared as the ruthless Head of the Red Team Bunny Battalion, Hopper rose to the rank of Colonel with dizzying speed. The promotion filled him with such exhilaration and such hunger for more that it consumed his every thought. His soldiers mistook his growing twitch for stress and began calling him “Colonel Panic”, but the truth was far more dangerous: the twitch came from his obsession with power, not fear.

In those days, Hopper had already played a crucial, though conveniently forgotten, role in the earliest whispers of the Wareville siege. Buried beneath secrecy and denied by the crown, those first experiments in breaching new digital frontiers were Hopper’s design. But when the King began distancing himself from the truth, Hopper’s contributions were quietly erased from history, and his fall from grace accelerated. We now find Hopper in his prison cell in HopSec Asylum.

## Asylum Escape Challenge 

You now take control of Hopper, with one ultimate goal. Free yourself from this wrongful imprisonment. To do this, you must follow Hopper's 5-step escape plan:

1. Unlock Hopper’s Cell
   
Your escape begins in the Cells and Storage area. Hopper is locked inside, and the door is secured with a digital lock. Your first task is to access the cell controls and unlock his door. Once Hopper is free, you can begin moving toward the lobby.

2. Move Through the Lobby
   
With the cell unlocked, head straight ahead into the lobby. This area connects the different blocks of the facility. Cameras are active, so stay alert. Your objective is to reach the Psych Ward entrance on the east side of the lobby.

3. Bypass the Psych Ward Keypad
   
The Psych Ward is protected by a keypad system. You must identify the correct code or exploit the keypad to continue. Once the keypad is bypassed, you will gain access to the Psych Ward Exit hallway.

4. Reach the Main Corridor
   
From the Psych Ward Exit you can move south and loop around into the Main Corridor. This is the final section of the escape route. The last challenge awaits here, and completing it will open the final exit door.

5. Escape the Facility
    
Solve the final challenge in the Main Corridor and make your way toward the exit marked on the map. Once the door opens, Hopper is free, and the escape is complete.
