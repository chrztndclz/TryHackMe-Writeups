## Welcome

Following the recent [SOC Level 1](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/soclevel1) path refresh, it's time for the ultimate test of your blue-team skills, the First Shift CTF! This beginner-friendly event features **six** unique scenarios, starting with quick warmups and classic SOC investigations you've seen in the path, and escalating to cases that push well beyond the typical L1 role. Check out the website for details:

The event kicks off on **January 24th at 17:00 GMT** and runs for four hours. For those who can't join, the challenges will be available even after the CTF. Until then, sharpen your analytical thinking and revisit the SOC topics - you will definitely need them. One final hint: be ready to Splunk your way to the flags!
