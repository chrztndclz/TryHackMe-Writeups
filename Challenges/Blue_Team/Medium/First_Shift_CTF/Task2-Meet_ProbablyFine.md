## Meet ProbablyFine

Haven't you heard about ProbablyFine? No way! ProbablyFine Ltd. is the most advanced, next-generation MSSP startup you can find for a reasonable price nowadays. Founded by experienced blue-teamers and DFR professionals, we take a radically honest approach to cyber security: don't dismiss alerts as False Positives, but reassure the client it's probably fine.

These were the words you heard during your SOC Level 1 onboarding. You were skilled and lucky enough to pass the internship, and now it's your first monitoring week at a top-tier MSSP! Sure, senior analysts are always ready to support and no one is about to throw you into an incident alone, but you never know what might happen at ProbablyFine.
