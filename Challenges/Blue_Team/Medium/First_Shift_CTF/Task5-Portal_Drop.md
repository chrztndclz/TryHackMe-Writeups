Portal Drop

You are on the day shift in the ProbablyFine when the monitoring dashboard flashes red. A new alert appears in the WAF summary, reporting a web scan on crm.trypatchme.thm followed by a suspicious file upload anomaly. The affected website is TryPatchMe's public-facing CRM portal, a valued customer who provides software patching consulting services.

That should be an easy case, since you have access to both the web access logs and the EDR console. Combined, they should give you a clear answer: either it's a False Positive, or the portal has been breached and TryPatchMe needs to patch the CRM now!

What is the IP address that initiated the brute force on the CRM web portal?
