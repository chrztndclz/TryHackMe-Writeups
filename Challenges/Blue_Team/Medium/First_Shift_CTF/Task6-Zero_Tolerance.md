Zero Tolerance

It was supposed to be a regular morning at ProbablyFine Ltd. L2 had just returned from paternity leave. L3 was hosting a live webinar on "Proactive Threat Hunting." The morning standup was the usual mix of coffee, ticket updates, and small talk about last night's football match. Then the Slack notification came through from Sales:

"NEW CLIENT ONBOARDED - VaultSecure Banking - Tier 1 Priority - Live monitoring starts NOW"

VaultSecure Banking wasn't just any client. They're a regional bank with two million customers. They had just fired their previous MSSP after a compliance audit revealed endpoints that had gone unmonitored for six months. The contract ProbablyFine signed was massive, enough to fund the company for the next two years. However, there’s a catch: a 90-day probation period with a "zero tolerance" clause - miss one critical alert, and the contract is terminated.
The Alert

You were barely skimming the onboarding docs before the SIEM lights up with a critical alert:

"CRITICAL: Suspicious Persistence Mechanism Detected - VaultSecure Banking"

You just stare at it for a second. It's been less than 4 hours since monitoring went live, and you're already staring at a critical alert. Your L2 is in back-to-back meetings with the new client. Your L3 is live on a webinar with 500 attendees. The company's future literally depends on how you handle this. For now, it's just you and this alert. It's time to show VaultSecure Banking why they chose ProbablyFine!
