# TryHackMe Writeups

Welcome to my [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) challenge writeups, created and maintained by [Christian](https://tryhackme.com/p/chrztndclz).  
These writeups are primarily a personal documentation of my learning process, but I hope they also help others understand the concepts and approaches behind each challenge.

This repository will gradually include detailed, step-by-step analyses for multiple rooms and categories — all flags are **redacted** to preserve the integrity of the platform.

## Challenge Collections

- [TryHackMe Room Writeups](rooms/README.md)  
  *(organized by room and category; more to be added over time)*

---

## No Spoilers Policy

All writeups contain thorough explanations of the **analysis**, **methodology**, and **tools used**, but **flags are never shown in full**.

Flags are displayed in one of the following redacted formats:

THM{abc---xyz}

This ensures fair play and compliance with TryHackMe’s ethical guidelines.

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as:  
- A **personal learning archive** for tracking cybersecurity progress.  
- A **reference resource** for students and CTF learners.  
- A **demonstration of applied security research** in web exploitation, forensics, cryptography, network attacks, and other CTF skills.
